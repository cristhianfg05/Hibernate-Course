# Hibernate Demo

This project showcases the implementation of fundamental CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Hibernate, a widely-used Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. The primary aim of this mini-project is to learn how to execute common database operations using Hibernate, both with HQL (Hibernate Query Language) and native SQL queries.

Please note that everything developed in this project is purely for illustrative purposes and is solved in the most generic way possible. The emphasis here is on providing a simple yet clear example of how to perform basic CRUD operations using Hibernate with a generic approach that can be adapted to different use cases and entities. This project does not aim to cover advanced or production-level implementations but serves as a foundation for understanding Hibernate's basic functionalities.
