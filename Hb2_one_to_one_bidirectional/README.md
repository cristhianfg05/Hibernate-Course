# Hibernate one to one bidirectional

This project showcases the implementation of a one-to-one bidirectional mapping using Hibernate, a widely-used Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. The main objective of this mini-project is to provide a clear demonstration of how to establish a bidirectional association between two entities, allowing them to refer to each other.

Please note that everything developed in this project is intended solely for illustrative purposes and is implemented in the most generic manner possible. The main focus is to present a straightforward and comprehensible example of how to establish a one-to-one bidirectional mapping using Hibernate. This project aims to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamentals of Hibernate's one-to-one bidirectional relationship and is not meant to cover advanced or production-level implementations. It serves as a starting point for learning how to create a bidirectional association between two entities, where both entities hold a reference to each other, allowing seamless navigation between the associated entities from either side. This concept can be adapted and extended to suit various use cases and entities in real-world applications.
