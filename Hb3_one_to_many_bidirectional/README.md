# Hibernate one to many bidirectional

This project showcases the implementation of a one-to-many bidirectional mapping using Hibernate, a popular Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. The main objective of this mini-project is to illustrate how to establish a bidirectional association between two entities, where one entity has a one-to-many relationship with another entity.

Please note that everything developed in this project is intended solely for illustrative purposes and is implemented in the most generic manner possible. The main focus is to present a clear and concise example of how to establish a one-to-many bidirectional mapping using Hibernate. This project aims to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamentals of Hibernate's one-to-many bidirectional relationship and is not meant to cover advanced or production-level implementations. It serves as a starting point for learning how to create a bidirectional association between two entities, where one entity has a one-to-many relationship with another entity.

The project demonstrates how to establish the bidirectional link between ParentEntity and ChildEntity, allowing seamless navigation between the associated entities from either side. This concept can be adapted and extended to suit various use cases and entities in real-world applications.
