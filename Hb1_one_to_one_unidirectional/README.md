This project illustrates a one-to-one unidirectional mapping using Hibernate, a popular Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. It serves as a simple and generic example to understand how to establish a one-to-one relationship between two entities. Please note that this is a purely illustrative case and is solved in the most generic manner, making it adaptable to different scenarios and entities.

Please note that everything developed in this project is intended solely for illustrative purposes and is implemented in the most generic manner possible. The main focus is to present a straightforward and comprehensible example of how to establish a one-to-one unidirectional mapping using Hibernate. This project aims to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamentals of Hibernate's one-to-one unidirectional relationship and is not meant to cover advanced or production-level implementations. It serves as a starting point for learning how to create a unidirectional association between two entities, which can be adapted and extended to suit various use cases and entities.
