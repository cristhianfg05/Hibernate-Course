# Hibernate many to many 

This project showcases the implementation of a many-to-many mapping using Hibernate, a popular Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework. The main objective of this mini-project is to illustrate how to establish an association between two entities, where both entities have a many-to-many relationship.

Please note that everything developed in this project is intended solely for illustrative purposes and is implemented in the most generic manner possible. The main focus is to present a clear and concise example of how to establish a many-to-many mapping using Hibernate. This project aims to provide a foundation for understanding the fundamentals of Hibernate's many-to-many relationship and is not meant to cover advanced or production-level implementations. It serves as a starting point for learning how to create an association between two entities with a many-to-many relationship.

The project demonstrates how to establish the link between ParentEntity and ChildEntity, enabling both entities to have multiple instances associated with each other. This concept allows seamless navigation between the associated entities. You can adapt and extend this concept to suit various use cases and entities in real-world applications.
